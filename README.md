# Compiler-miniC
This repository contains a compiler developed for the MiniC programming language as part of a university project. It was built during my second year of studies and includes components such as lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of compiler design and implementation.
